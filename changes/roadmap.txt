A little speculative roadmap:

N: This version.

N+1: Copying, moving and deleting files. Some refactoring of WSGI components.

N+2: Using REMOTE_USER to determine the username to commit with, or something
     like that. More refactoring of WSGI components.

N+3: RSS or atom feeds. Diffs between arbitrary revisions. More refactoring.
