0.4.1 (2010-01-30)
------------------

 * Better hbmp handling


0.4 (2010-01-30)
----------------

 * Fix mimetype handling which seems to have been really quite broken
   for god knows how long. It now all behaves as you'd expect.

 * Abstract out template_loader option, which should be a callable
   which takes a (template_name, data_dict) and returns a string.
   The default is the existing Tempita stuff. This interface will
   probably change. It can be an object configured however it likes,
   currently that's just handled in the paste.deploy factory.

 * Internal refactoring of components for easier pluggability of
   custom edit apps (which handle editform, addform and save) and
   view apps (which handle rendering)

   Demo of custom view apps: custom display for text/csv+hbmp format!


0.3 (2010-01-30)
----------------

 * When displaying an edit form for a file that does not exist,
   use the return value of mimetypes.guess_type as the default
   mimetype for the file in the form. If no guessable mimetype
   is found, the default is 'text/html'.

   This behavior can be overridden by subclassing SvnWikiView
   and implementing a custom `new_file_default_mimetype_policy`
   method. The method should take a `request` argument.


0.2 (2010-01-26)
----------------

 * BZR repositories are now supported. This is much faster than
   SVN. To use, simply add 'svenweb.repo_type=bzr' to your
   paste.deploy configuration.

 * Added a WSGI middleware filter to set a response's Content-type
   header based on the versioned mimetype property of a resource.
   It can be used independent of the rest of svenweb, for example
   if you want to publish the current contents of your versioned
   resources with a static file server. Use like

       [filter:contenttype]
       use = egg:svenweb#content_type
       checkout_dir = /path/to_your/checkout/
       default_content_type = text/plain
       repo_type = bzr

    The 'repo_type' and 'default_content_type' settings are optional.


0.1.1 (2010-01-03)
------------------

First release.
